## Journal entry

As I am only a casual gamer, I am not that much affine with typical terms used in gaming. So I have learned basics on games including mechanics, gameplay loop and so on. I very much liked the approach of short games, as it appeals to my gaming habits. During our ideation phase for our game, it was challenging to develop a basic idea of a game that is reduced to the max. We have lots of ideas, but we were luckily able to come up with a basic idea that can be extended based on how much time we have left.

## What is a game, what is a play?

TODO: Explain how can be defined and what make a game a game and how a "play" differs from a game

## The core of a game

Main questions:
- What is the goal of the player?
- What obstacles are used? How can they be overcome?

### Gameplay loop

The gameloop is a collective set of actions that the player will be doing over a specific time frame.
These actions can be implemented in different ways.

### Mechanics

TODO: general description of mechanics

#### Primary mechanics

These mechanics are use repeatedly and are essential for progressing in a game.

#### Secondary mechanics

These mechanics are used as secondary elements and do not belong to the main gameplay loop.

#### Examples

- Super Mario Bros: jump, run, shoot, eat
- Angry Bird: Aim, shoot, physics(structures collapsing)
- Limbo: Run, climb, jump, push & pull

### Agency

Agency in games is the degree to which a player is able to cause significant change in a game world. This can differ very much in games. For example in Skyrim, you are very much able to choose your own path on how you progress the game, whereas in other games, there is a fixed storyline that you can't choose freely. Other aspects also include, how your actions in a game affect the outcome.

### Feedback

Feedback is one of the most important elements of game design, as it communicates to the player how they are performing, what they can do, and what the consequences of their actions are. Feedback can be visual, auditory, tactile, or even emotional, and it can be positive, negative, or neutral.

### Game state

Game state defines what different phases you go through in a game. For example in a shooter game, you often have a lobby state where you choose map, team, class, gear and so on. You then have one or multiple rounds which often end after a specific duration. After the round, you will see the results and if you have won/lost.

## Excercise: Analyze Game Loco Motion

- [Itch.io - Loco Motion](https://josia-roncancio.itch.io/loco-motion)

### Actions/verbs/mechanics

- draw
- reset
- fast forward
- Physics(gravity, collision)

### Rules

- you have to draw "two" wheels
- wheels rotate clockwise
- one try for one single run

### Gameplay loop

![Loco motion gameplay loop](loco%20motion%20game%20loop.png)

### Goals

- Complete course forward direction
- Bonus: complete it as fast as possible

### Objects

- floor
- obstacles
- runner with "wheels"

### Playspace

- obstacle course

### Space of possibility

- up to the player as you have many possibilities to draw "wheel"
  - timing is important as the first "wheel" starts spinning after is has been drawn

### Player(s)

- 2D single player

### Setup

- drawn world
- bar
- Compare "wheels" with other players
- Compare time with other players

### Feedback

- for an optimal start one should begin to draw on the right point of the runner
- Progress/No progress on course
- Drawing along mouse path

### Question for Lorenzo

- How much are people willing to pay for a short game?
  - free with donations
  - before you play: small amount
  - idea: create a collection of small games and sell as a package

### Small is beautiful

Small games are beautiful as you sometimes don't have the time to play longer games. Like that, they can also be experienced in one gaming session.
Like that, more games can be explored as they don't take too much time.
With small games, ideas can be tested and boundaries can be pushed.

#### Why make small games as a student

- learn fast
- go through whole process of making a game
- having complete control of all aspects of the game
  - design
  - narrative
  - visual
  - audio
  - marketing
- New and different tools can be used
- Unusual/experimental approaches can be tested
