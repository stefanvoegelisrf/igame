## Daily journal
We were tasked to do a daily journal to help us document process during game development. Sharing progress with a community is important to get the attention of press and possible players of a game.

### 15.11.2023
As I am only a casual gamer, I am not that much affine with typical terms used in gaming. So I have learned basics on games including mechanics, gameplay loop and so on. I very much liked the approach of short games, as it appeals to my gaming habits. During our ideation phase for our game, it was challenging to develop a basic idea of a game that is reduced to the max. We have lots of ideas, but we were luckily able to come up with a basic idea that can be extended based on how much time we have left.

### 16.11.2023
We had great collaboration in our team. We as a Team and I struggled a bit with how we want to plan the project, which is a topic we will tackle next. Like this we can have a better structure and more focused work. The intro into Unity was a bit overwhelming(regarding speed) why I decided to only take notes and look into the tutorials myself.

### 17.11.2023
We made good progress on our level design and were able to create a prototype for it. We were able to define our major milestones which helped me get a sense of when we need to achieve what milestone. Time in general is where I see the challenge currently, which has encouraged me to take the lead in our team regarding pushing forward and urging to make decisions. I think I managed to do it in a way that it was comfortable for our team and not be too pushy.

### 22.11.2023
We did not face any major challenges today. The main challenge for me was to get started in Unity and get to know it's inner workings. Having someone on our Team who knows Unity already, helps a lot so I can ask him instead of figuring it our myself. Our Teamwork is very constructive and solution oriented which makes it very pleasant.

### 23.11.2023
The main challenge for today was to get our development setup correct, where the main issue was, that we installed the wrong .NET SDK. This took a lot of my energy, but luckily I was able to recover from being angry about it. In the afternoon, we were able to do pair programming and we finally had our maze set up in Unity. We also achieved some basic movement which made me quite happy.

### 24.11.2023
Today we were able to make progress with our sprites, navigation and some effects. My challenge was to create some of the effects, especially creating a script to change the hue of sprites. As I didnâ€˜t want to create a shader, I had to do it with copying the textures. The main problem was in how the texture was applied. Luckily, with some research and help from ChatGPT, I got my script working.
