## Question for Lorenzo

- How much are people willing to pay for a short game?
  - free with donations
  - before you play: small amount
  - idea: create a collection of small games and sell as a package

## Small is beautiful

Small games are beautiful as you sometimes don't have the time to play longer games. Like that, they can also be experienced in one gaming session.
Like that, more games can be explored as they don't take too much time.
With small games, ideas can be tested and boundaries can be pushed.

- having complete control of all aspects of the game
  - design
