## What is a game, what is a play?

A game is a structured form of play, typically guided by a specific set of rules or objectives, which may involve mental or physical challenges, and often includes interaction with others or a challenging environment. In contrast, a play is a form of artistic expression in theatre, focused on narrative and performance, without a fixed set of rules like a game. The content of a play can be adapted or changed by the participants, allowing for creative interpretation and expression in its enactment.

## The core of a game

Main questions:
- What is the goal of the player?
- What obstacles are used? How can they be overcome?

### Gameplay loop

The gameloop is a collective set of actions that the player will be doing over a specific time frame.
These actions can be implemented in different ways.

### Mechanics

Game mechanics are defined as any action performed by a player that modifies the game state, that is, the position and specific characteristics of all objects and environments present in the game at a precise moment in time.

#### Primary mechanics

These mechanics are use repeatedly and are essential for progressing in a game.

#### Secondary mechanics

These mechanics are used as secondary elements and do not belong to the main gameplay loop.

#### Examples

- Super Mario Bros: jump, run, shoot, eat
- Angry Bird: Aim, shoot, physics(structures collapsing)
- Limbo: Run, climb, jump, push & pull

### Agency

Agency in games is the degree to which a player is able to cause significant change in a game world. This can differ very much in games. For example in Skyrim, you are very much able to choose your own path on how you progress the game, whereas in other games, there is a fixed storyline that you can't choose freely. Other aspects also include, how your actions in a game affect the outcome.

### Feedback

Feedback is one of the most important elements of game design, as it communicates to the player how they are performing, what they can do, and what the consequences of their actions are. Feedback can be visual, auditory, tactile, or even emotional, and it can be positive, negative, or neutral.

### Game state

Game state defines what different phases you go through in a game. For example in a shooter game, you often have a lobby state where you choose map, team, class, gear and so on. You then have one or multiple rounds which often end after a specific duration. After the round, you will see the results and if you have won/lost.
