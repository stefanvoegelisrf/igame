We made good progress on our level design and were able to create a prototype for it. We were able to define our major milestones which helped me get a sense of when we need to achieve what milestone. Time in general is where I see the challenge currently, which has encouraged me to take the lead in our team regarding pushing forward and urging to make decisions. I think I managed to do it in a way that it was comfortable for our team and not be too pushy.
