## Pixel art

### Choosing pixel art size

> Is is easier to choose a smaller size

Questions to ask for choosing size:
- What is the smallest object that needs to be displayed?
- Is there really a need for bigger resolution? Does the gameplay require bigger resolution? 

## Journal entry

We did not face any major challenges today. The main challenge for me was to get started in Unity and get to know it's inner workings. Having someone on our Team who knows Unity already, helps a lot so I can ask him instead of figuring it our myself. Our Teamwork is very constructive and solution oriented which makes it very pleasant.
